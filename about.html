    <p> I'm a cartographer, geographer, and artist based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm currently a research associate with Colorado State University, embedded as a cartographer for the National Park Service. This site houses much of the work I have developed over the previous years as a freelance cartographer, during which time I specialized in guide maps, navigational maps, thematic maps for scholarly publications, and large-format hand-drawn maps. Though no longer freelancing, I will continue to exhibit my side projects and cartographic investigations here, as well as some of my NPS-related work. I also completed the University of Kentucky's online New Maps Plus graduate certificate program in digital mapping.</p>

    <h3>The long version</h3>

    <p>Before joining the NPMap team at the National Park Service, I was a freelance cartographer, designer, and GIS consultant in Chicago. Up until January 2013, I was the Geospatial Historian at <a href="http://spatialhistory.stanford.edu/">the Spatial History Project</a> at Stanford University, where I provided training in GIS and cartographic design and advised research projects in a lab environment. I completed a Master of Arts in Geography at San Jos&#233; State University, during which time I was a Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities Planning Intern at the City of Oakland. My academic research interests focused on cartographic design and history. Maps, like written documents, are imperfect and subjective human creations; studying these visual documents can reveal the intentions and/or biases of the map authors and point to their reliability.</p>

	<p>In my own cartographic work, I've explored how to incorporate the dimension of time in order to depict changes in geographic distributions, using both static multiples and animated presentations. I also have a keen interest in the process of abstraction and generalization that occurs in the cartographic design process, and have experienced it indirectly in my digital work, and tangibly in my hand-drawn maps. Each map project is an opportunity to explore cartographic design issues related to projection and areal extent, scale and generalization, text placement, symbolization of categories and quantitative data, among others. Cartographers are presented with an infinite number of design choices, and happily, the number of maps needed to help us understand our world is only increasing.</p>

	<p>I see an opportunity with my mapmaking practice to engage viewers to consider the hand of the cartographer in shaping the visual outcome of maps and their expressive capabilities. Cartographic traditions and visual conventions are alternately embraced and subverted. I create maps by hand that are rich in minute detail and reward a viewer's extended study, while reframing a familiar place in a new light. Increasingly I see my mapmaking as a platform for investigation. I explore the human-altered landscape and how individual locations combine to form interconnected regions.</p>

	<p>The long study of sources and field observations required for detailed maps creates an awareness of place. I use the mapmaking process to learn about the world we live in. It is a means of place-making&mdash;of forming images of our world in our minds. I seek to create alternative and complementary perspectives (images) of familiar places. To carefully compose a map of a place and speak truthfully to some aspect of its reality is to express a respect, a love, a hope for that place.</p>
